This is the starter code for students in the worldwide content version of CSE 210.

## Modified by [IKEKWEM DANIEL]

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects that I will use to complete the coursework for CSE 210. They are arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that I will use to experiment with and practice various concepts.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments to help reinforce foundational C# programming skills.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities, which will help me get ready for the major projects.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the Prove Developer projects, where I will demonstrate my understanding and skills learned.
* `foundation` - Starter projects for foundation projects that will build on the core programming concepts.

I look forward to learning and growing through this coursework!
